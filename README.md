# React + Vite

This project is set up with React and Vite, providing a minimal yet powerful environment for development. It includes Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and comes with a basic ESLint configuration to help maintain code quality.

## Getting Started

To install and run this Vite project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js (version 14 or later) installed on your machine. You'll also need either npm or yarn as your package manager.

### Installation

1. First, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate into the project directory.

2. Next, install the project dependencies. If you're using npm, simply run `npm install`. For those using yarn, run `yarn install`.

### Running the Project

To start the development server, you can use the command `npm run dev` if you're using npm, or `yarn dev` if you're using yarn. This will launch the server and the project will be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

### Building for Production

When you're ready to build the project for production, you can do so by running the build command. For npm users, this is `npm run build`, and for yarn users, it's `yarn build`. The production-ready files will be output to the `dist` directory.

### Linting

To maintain code quality, you can run ESLint by using the linting command. If you use npm, this would be `npm run lint`, and for yarn users, it's `yarn lint`.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `public/` - Contains static assets that are served directly.
- `src/` - This is where the source code lives, including React components and styles.
- `.gitignore` - Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git.
- `README.md` - The documentation file you are currently reading.
- `eslint.config.js` - Configuration file for ESLint.
- `index.html` - The main HTML file for the project.
- `package-lock.json` - Automatically generated file that locks the versions of installed npm dependencies.
- `package.json` - Contains metadata about the project, including dependencies and scripts.
- `vite.config.js` - Configuration file for Vite.

## Official Plugins

This project can use the following official Vite plugins:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): Utilizes [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh, ensuring that your development experience is quick and smooth.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh, offering an alternative to Babel.

Feel free to explore these plugins to see which one best suits your development needs.
